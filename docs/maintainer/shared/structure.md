# Docs structure (maintainer)

Every page should answer:

1. What is this for?
2. Who is it for?
3. What can the reader do with it?

## Recommended page skeleton

- Title
- 1–2 sentence summary
- Sections with actionable headings
- Links to next relevant pages

For spec pages, prefer: scope → guarantees → non-guarantees → edge cases.
