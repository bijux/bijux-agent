# Docs style (maintainer)

## Formatting

- Use short paragraphs and bullets.
- Prefer tables for enums, matrices, and contracts.
- Avoid long prose where a checklist works.

## Linking

- Prefer relative links inside `docs/`.
- When referencing code, include a path (e.g. `src/bijux_agent/tracing/trace.py`).

## Code blocks

- Use fenced code blocks with a language tag (`bash`, `json`, `yaml`, `python`).
- Keep snippets minimal and correct.
