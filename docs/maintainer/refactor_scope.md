# Refactor scope (maintainer)

## In scope

- internal module restructuring
- improved tracing and replay tooling
- configuration cleanup (without breaking the contract)
- tests that tighten invariants

## Out of scope (without explicit design work)

- new product features unrelated to auditability
- stateful cross-run storage
- dynamic user-defined pipeline graphs

If you want to expand scope, start with a design note and update the spec.
