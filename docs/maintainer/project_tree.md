# Project tree

High-signal directories:

- `src/bijux_agent/` — library and runtime code
- `tests/` — unit + invariant tests
- `docs/` — MkDocs sources (this directory)
- `config/` — runtime configuration examples
- `api/` — OpenAPI schema and API assets
- `makefiles/` — Make targets used by CI and developers

Generated artifacts belong under `artifacts/` (or under the CLI `--out` directory).
