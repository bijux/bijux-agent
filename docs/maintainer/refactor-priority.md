# Refactor priority (maintainer)

This is an opinionated priority list for improving correctness and maintainability.

1. **Artifact correctness first**: trace validity, taxonomy correctness, schema discipline.
2. **Single adapter interface**: reduce backend complexity behind one contract.
3. **Trace richness**: phase-level entries and better diagnostics.
4. **Ergonomics**: CLI/API parity, clearer configuration surface.
5. **Performance**: only after correctness is boring.

Avoid polishing UX while the contract is still moving.
