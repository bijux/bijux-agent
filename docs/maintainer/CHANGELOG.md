# Maintainer changelog

This file tracks maintainer-relevant changes that may not be visible to end users.

## Principles

- Keep entries short and factual.
- Prefer linking to PRs/commits when used in the real repository.
- Record changes that affect:
  - invariants
  - versioning decisions
  - tooling / CI gates
  - trace or taxonomy discipline

(End-user changes belong in the root `CHANGELOG.md`.)
