# Documentation voice (maintainer)

Write like a senior engineer speaking to another senior engineer:

- lead with the thing the reader is trying to do,
- state requirements vs recommendations clearly,
- prefer concrete examples over slogans,
- keep the spec narrow and test-backed,
- avoid hand-wavy language (“probably”, “usually”) in contract pages.
